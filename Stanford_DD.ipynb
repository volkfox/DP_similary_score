There's a very diverse range of\",\n",

And I think it's because the third point that it highlights here and that it bounces power between larger and smaller States and electing a president. That's kind of like the key fundamental issue like between I guess between a pro and a con stance that like a Statewide like Wyoming is going to have much less power than a state like, California but by doing so and having like. The number of Representatives like all having an equal share and over the people. I think that's really important and why you shouldn't replace the Electoral College with a national popular vote\",\n",
