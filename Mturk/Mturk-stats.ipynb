But I think that one of the things that this current housing system does is it makes people go out and do this at your extracurricular activities and those things and that's why Stanford has a stronger extracurricular Community by students than any other school, and that's why there are so many student-run clubs and organizations because people are finding those communities those for you communities both in their residences and out., \n",

I think these are all really relevant environmental justice, you know, we could probably add more.

So in this question, I think there's a couple points of conflict that I see so firstly the phraseology that uses promote democracy and I don't see why we wouldn't want to promote democracy.

I don't think that most people at Stanford is because we have so much money have a hard time paying for Stanford and like at the end of the day we are still going to get a Stanford degree at the end of this and so I think that like the value of what we're getting is is pretty similar like by the time that we graduate., \n",
